The goal of this exercise is to create a product to highlight the
prediction algorithm that you have built and to provide an interface
that can be accessed by others via a Shiny app..

*Tasks to accomplish*

Create a data product to show off your prediction algorithm You should
create a Shiny app that accepts an n-gram and predicts the next word.

*Questions to consider*

1.  What are the most interesting ways you could show off your
    algorithm?
2.  Are there any data visualizations you think might be helpful (look
    at the Swiftkey data dashboard if you have it loaded on your phone)?
3.  How should you document the use of your data product (separately
    from how you created it) so that others can rapidly deploy your
    algorithm?

*Tips, tricks, and hints*

Consider the size of the predictive model you have developed. You may
have to sacrifice some accuracy to have a fast enough/small enough model
to load into Shiny.
