Developing data products
This is the Shiny code for the Data Products Coursera course taught by John Hopkins University.

Synopsis
This is the user-interface definition of a Shiny web application that illustrates the effect of noise on a signal. The shiny app is deployed at this shinyapps website and the slide deck is at this gh-pages website.

Project instructions and guidelines
Your Shiny Application
Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started using your application.

Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server

Share the application link by pasting it into the provided text box

Share your server.R and ui.R code on github

The application must include the following:

Some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...)
Some operation on the ui input in server.R
Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations
You must also include enough documentation so that a novice user could use your application.
The documentation should be at the Shiny website itself. Do not post to an external link.
The Shiny application in question is entirely up to you. However, if you're having trouble coming up with ideas, you could start from the simple prediction algorithm done in class and build a new algorithm on one of the R datasets packages. Please make the package simple for the end user, so that they don't need a lot of your prerequisite knowledge to evaluate your application. You should emphasize a simple project given the short time frame.

Your Reproducible Pitch Presentation
OK, you've made your shiny app, now it's time to make your pitch. You get 5 slides (inclusive of the title slide) to pitch a your app. You're going to create a web page using Slidify or Rstudio Presenter with an html5 slide deck.

Here's what you need

5 slides to pitch our idea done in Slidify or Rstudio Presenter
Your presentation pushed to github or Rpubs
A link to your github or Rpubs presentation pasted into the provided text box
Your presentation must satisfy the following

It must be done in Slidify or Rstudio Presenter
It must be 5 pages
It must be hosted on github or Rpubs
It must contained some embedded R code that gets run when slidifying the document
